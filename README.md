# Time-Series-Analysis

A time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. 
Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Examples of time series are heights of 
ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average.
Four components of time series are:
•          Secular trend, which describe the movement along the term;
•          Seasonal variations, which represent seasonal changes;
•          Cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to periodical but not seasonal variations;
•          Irregular variations, which are other non-random sources of variations of series.
Based on timeseries theories in statistics, this study analyzes two datasets and offers a plausible 
model that can persuasively explain its timeseries pattern. As a result, examining these datasets 
should provide a great opportunity for students, particularly those who are just starting to 
understand timeseries models, to practice their knowledge and develop their statistical analytic 
skills.
The project's seasonal and non-seasonal datasets are as follows:
1.Temperature change in Delhi, India, and forecasting future temperatures
2. Commercial banks' assets and liabilities in the United States to anticipate credit growth rate
